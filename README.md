# Personal Website 
This website hosts all my personal projects and other information about myself and my work. 
Although there are many website-building software made for github pages, such as Jekyll, I decided to put myself through the 
horrors of building a website completely from scratch on my own. As such, please forgive all the awful formatting and issues that
may occur.
