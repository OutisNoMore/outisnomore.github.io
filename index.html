      This website is hosted as a static website on github using the free github pages service. Although there are a number of website-building products, such as Jekyll, that provides developers with a relatively easy to use framework for hosting a website on github, the decision has been made to subject myself to the horrors of building a website completely from scratch. In short, this website documents the journey of a developer whose lost soul wanders through the terrifying and intricate labryinth of born of the trinity known as: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
